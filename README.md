1)jetbot IP address apears on the jetbot(mine is 172.16.158.19), and open the browser(ubuntu or window)

2)then type the 'jetbot IP address':8888(172.16.158.19:8888) in the search box

3)I opened jupitor lab and could open jetbot argorithm 

4)Althought the frame is arranged, the motion is not arranged super correctly, so I had to set up the motion corresponding with the  command

5)But I had some problems-I changed the command in argoithm, but the motion of jetbot don't change at all. I thought I have to find the problem.

6)I tried for one and a half hours, but I couldn't solve this problem, so I should solve the problem temporarily. I turned the software of button, checking the motion is acting correctly according to the superficial button.
(But I want to transform the software in-the-long-term)

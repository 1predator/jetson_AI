1)jetbot IP address apears on the jetbot(mine is 172.16.158.19), and open the browser(ubuntu or window)

2)then type the 'jetbot IP address':8888(172.16.158.19:8888) in the search box

3)I opened jupitor lab and could open jetbot argorithm 

4)Althought the frame is arranged, the motion is not arranged super correctly, so I had to set up the motion corresponding with the  command

5)But I had some problems-I changed the command in argoithm, but the motion of jetbot don't change at all. I thought I have to find the problem.
